- Function for updating the data which exists 
- Function for deleting the data which exists 
- Updating the data 
- Deleting data 
- Closing database connection 

This program is designed to be user friendly and easy to use. It is written in Python and utilizes the MySQL Connector/Python library to provide access to the database. 

To get started, you will need to install the MySQL Connector/Python library. Once installed, you can use the program to connect to your database. You can then create a table, insert data, fetch data, update data, and delete data.

When you are finished with your database operations, you can close the database connection. This will ensure that all data is saved and that no connections remain open.
